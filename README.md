Is is written in rust, here is how to install it:

To Install Rust
===============

The Simplex
===========

Usage :
```bash
toto [--bland] [--latex] file.lp
```

There are two heuristics for the choice of the entering variable:
Bland's rule (which terminates), and choosing the one with the 
greatest coefficient, which seems to be faster.

Note: In the PDF output, the name of the variables might not be the same
as those in the input program and x_0 is the constant factor.
